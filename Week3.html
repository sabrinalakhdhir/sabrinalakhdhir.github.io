This piece of art will use information regarding Google Search Trends; searched items will work to create an image.
More frequently searched items will appear larger and brighter, whereas less frequently searched items will appear smaller and duller in appearance.
<br>
The image will be predefined with areas of brightness & darkness, so when a searched term is brought in, it'll be placed in an area where its search frequency matches the required brightness.
