<h3> <b> Week 5 Assignment: </b> </h3>

<p> 
I made a gif of an explosion. I used an online gif maker to put the animation together. <br>
I first found a picture of a bomb with a spark & placed it inside of a square (I used this as my boundary to ensure each image was the same size). I then took multiple screenshots, moving the ball a little bit with each screenshot. <br>
The gif maker took these images in order and put them in a really quick slideshow. <br>
Below is one of the images I used in producing my animation. The remainder of the images were created as a result of moving the bomb and spark across the screen.
