<b>1. How does the allowed interacton keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? </b><br>
<br>
  By limiting the objects in the interactive piece that the user is allowed to interact with, the artist is able to ensure the user stays on track
  with a somewhat consistent story, regardless of the choices they make. Nonetheless, it still allows for variations and branches off the main 
  story line by allowing users to choose if they interact with objects, as well as by allowing users to choose when they interact with some objects. <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. </b><br>
<br>
  By having a simple and grayscale graphical design, the simplicity of the narrative is maintained in its visual appearance. I believe this is relevant to the story 
  because it ensures the focus is placed on interactable objects, changes in these objects based on the users choices, as well as the interactions
  and user's charcter interactions.<br>
  For example, the grayscale visual appearance allows emphasis to be placed on any colours that appear due to interaction and/or any movement which is either 
  a result of interactions or by interactable objects. Some examples of this include the flashing alarm clock, the TV screen, and the colour of the elevator button.<br>
  <br>
<b>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </b><br>
  <br>
  The interaction itself is quite short and limited. Personally, this influenced my chhoices because I attempted to interact with the art in as many ways as possible, whether it
  showed as an option or not. Finding that only a few objects were interactable was somewhat disappointing because it meant the art was extremely simple and had very 
  few possible branches and final outcomes. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Description of actions taken and their results AND description of the branches the story takes because of your choices. </b><br><br>
- walked to wardrobe, pressed space and got dressed<br>
- walked to alarm (red flashing light), pressed space to turn it off (flashing light goes away) <br>
- walked to wife, pressed space, nothing happened<br>
- walked to flashing tv, pressed space to turn it off<br>
- pressed space at elevator button, turned red<br>
- pressed space when doors opened to enter elevator<br> 
- walked into lady in the elevator, pressed space to get a speech bubble from her <br>
      - did this one on multiple rounds and her count would decrease (but nothing happened if you got to 1, it would just give you the message with the number 1 again) <br>
- taken outside building <br>
- walk right : at the end of the page you are taken into car and are driving (no matter how fast or slow you go, no accident or anything occurs - if you dont move everything is just stopped until you do)<br>
      - once you are out of the car, if you just wait, a leaf blows by off a nearby tree, if you walk past it nothing happens<br>
      - at the end of the page you have entered your office <br>
      - the boss tells you that you are late and to go to your cubicle <br>
      - you walk the span of one or two pages to get to your cubicle <br>
      - once at cubicle, pressed space to sit down and start working <br>
      - if you walk past the cubicle, you leave the building and jump off the building to your death and end up back in your bedroom at the start of the interaction <br> 
- walk left : at the end of the page you are taken to an intersection - here there is a hobo who you can interact with but this results in the end of the interaction (you are back in your bedroom with the flashing alarm) <br>
  <br>
- with each round I found new interactable elements - limited choices of interactable objects because you will see the name of the object pop up at the bottom when it is interactable <br>
- some items can only be interacted with once then they disappear the next time you play through the interaction (example: hobo, blowing leaf animation) <br>
- some items will react differently based on choices you have made <br>
      - for example, the boss fires you when you go to work without getting dressed, the lady in the elevator decreases s cherunt every time you walk towards/into her<br>
