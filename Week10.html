1. How does the allowed interacton keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches? <br>
<br>
  By limiting the objects in the interactive piece that the user is allowed to interact with, the artist is able to ensure the user stays on track
  with a somewhat consistent story, regardless of the choices they make. Nonetheless, it still allows for variations and branches off the main 
  story line by allowing users to choose if they interact with objects, as well as by allowing users to choose when they interact with some objects. <br>
  <br>
2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. <br>
<br>
  By having a simple and grayscale graphical design, the simplicity of the narrative is maintained in its visual appearance. I believe this is relevant to the story 
  because it ensures the focus is placed on interactable objects, changes in these objects based on the users choices, as well as the interactions
  and user's charcter interactions.<br>
  For example, the grayscale visual appearance allows emphasis to be placed on any colours that appear due to interaction and/or any movement which is either 
  a result of interactions or by interactable objects. <br>
  <br>
3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. <br>
<br>
<br>
Description of actions taken and their results. <br><br>
- walked to wardrobe, pressed space and got dressed<br>
- walked back to alarm (red flashing light), pressed space to turn it off<br>
- walked to wife, pressed space, nothing happened<br>
- walked to flashing tv, pressed space to turn it off<br>
- pressed space at button, turned red<br>
- pressed space when doors opened to enter elevator<br> 
- takne outside building <br>
- into car driving<br>
- leaf blew by once out of car<br>
- boss told me i was late and to go to my cubicle<br>
- with each round found new interactable elements - limited choices of interactable objects because you will see the name of the object pop up at the bottom when it is interactable <br>- some items can only be interacted with once then they disappear the next time you play through the interaction (example: hobo) <br>
- some items will react differently based on choices you have made - ex. boss fires you when you go to work without getting dressed, lady in elevator decreases step count every time you walk towards her<br>
Description of the branches the story takes because of your choices. <br>
