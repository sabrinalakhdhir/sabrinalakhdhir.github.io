      I am studying Computer Science at the University of Calgary. I am also taking a minor in Visual Art and Art History. <br>
      I am pursuing a career in the field of Human-Computer Interactions, but I also have interests in animation, graphics, and architecture.
      I also have an interest in the Computational Media Design (CMD) Masters program at the University of Calgary 
      (more information regarding the CMD program: <a href= "https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/graduate/explore-programs/computational-media-design-master-science-thesis-based">
