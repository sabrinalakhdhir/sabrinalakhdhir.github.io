I am studying Computer Science at the University of Calgary. I am also taking a minor in Visual Art and Art History. 
I am pursuing a career in the field of Human-Computer Interactions, but I also have interests in animation, graphics, and architecture.
I also have an interest in the Computational Media Design (CMD) Masters program at the University of Calgary (more information regarding the CMD program: <a href= "https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/graduate/explore-programs/computational-media-design-master-science-thesis-based"> Computational Media Design (CMD)</a>).
