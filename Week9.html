  Capture a video teaching how to say Mother, Cold, and Thank you in American Sign Language. <br>
  Use video, images, text, and sound to create a video teaching each of the three signs. <br>
  
  <br>
  I used iMovie to combine all the elements. I first took the images and placed them into the movie with a small banner of text
  explaining the actions to be performed. I also ensured each image was preceded with a title of what word was being taught. <br>
  I then captured a video of the action, as well as an audio clip explaining the action. I overlapped the audio clip with the still and the video.
  This ensures that the audience has both visual, audio, and text explanations of how to say each word in American Sign Language.
